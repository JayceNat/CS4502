Project Title: Crime Time Together With Weather
Team members: Jackson Markowski, Jayce Meyer, Miles Shayler, Conor Walsh

Description of the project: The goal of our work was to discover correlations between crime data, when the crime occurred, 
  where the crime occurred in the Denver area, and what the weather was like at the time of the crime. 
  We used data sets from the Denver Police Department for our crime data, and we gathered our weather data from NOAA databases.

Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers: With our research, we wanted to find out What were the correlations (if any) 
  between weather, crime, time, and location in the Denver area.
    - We found that (using weather data from 2013) most crimes happened on days with rain. There was roughly 56% chance for crime 
    on a rainy day in 2013.
    - As far as temperature, we found that the peak amount of crimes occurred between 80 and 90 degrees F. 
    - As far as time of day for all crimes, the least likely time for crime is around 5am. The most likely time for crime is around 10pm.
    - Location, on the other hand, was very difficult to use. We found it difficult to match up the locations with the crimes, 
    due to discontinuity in the decimal measurements of some of the recorded latitude and longitude values.

Application of this knowledge: Using this knowledge we have gathered from our data, we can apply it to daily life. 
  The most applicable thing that can be taken away from what we've found, in our opinion, is safety. It is mostly common sense
  that you're more likely to witness or be a victim of a crime during the night hours, but it is helpful to have data that
  both reinforces and confirms this to be the case.
