## Description of the project
The goal of our work was to discover correlations between crimes and the environment within the Denver area. In terms of the environment we looked at aspects such as weather, time of day, and location. We used a data set from the Denver Police Department for the crime data, and we gathered the weather data from NOAA databases.

## Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers
With our research, we wanted to find out what are the correlations (if any) between weather, crime, time, and location in the Denver area.
- We found that (using weather data from 2012 to 2017) most crimes happened on days with rain. There was roughly a 47.5% chance for crime on a rainy day between 2012 and 2017.
- As far as temperature, we found that the peak amount of crimes occurred between 80 and 90 degrees F. 
- As far as time of day for all crimes, the least likely time for crime is around 5am. The most likely time for crime is around 10pm.
- The locations of crimes heavily varies by the type of crime.  Obviously crimes such as shoplifting or alcohol possession tend to occur most frequently in high traffic business type areas.  Whereas crimes such as auto theft or harassment are distributed more evenly across Denver.

## Application of this knowledge
  Using this knowledge we have gathered from our data, we can apply it to daily life. 
  The most applicable thing that can be taken away from what we've found, in our opinion, is safety. It is mostly common sense that you're more likely to witness or be a victim of a crime during the night hours, but it is helpful to have data that both reinforces and confirms this to be the case.  In general, the information we found on when crime or specific crimes are more lickly to occure is an important aspect of law enforcement and can be applied in a variety of ways to better protect the public.
