This is crime and precipiation data from 2013. From this data we can begin to make some correlations with rain and crime.

The graphs here show that in 2013 there were 8 months that had more crimes on rainy days than crimes on days with no rain. These graphs also demonstrate that there seems to be many more crimes towards the end of the year. For example, December had the most amount of crimes for both rainy and non-rainy days.

This data does include traffic-addicent reports. If we need to remove those I can do that.
